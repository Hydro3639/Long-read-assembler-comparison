This repo contains the scripts used for our upcoming paper comparing long-read assemblers. It should be available shortly â€“ stay tuned!

Are you interested in the older version of this comparison which was hosted here on GitHub? You can still find it [here](https://github.com/rrwick/Long-read-assembler-comparison/tree/96dfbe7e6edd6195cdd7fbe6f532f0022a7ebbb9).
